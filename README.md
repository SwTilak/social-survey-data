# General Social Survey US 2016 Data

 In this project, weâ€™re going to be building and deploying a python data analytics web application leveraging the General Social Survey data, which collects information and records of behaviors, experiences, and opinions of residents of the Us and is funded by the National Science Foundation, particularly finding the correlation between education, income, and happiness for US residents in 2016. 
 


## Requirements
These requirements are mainly python modules including streamlite pandas plotli numpy matplot lib and pillow.

Streamlit is an open source python framework that machine learning and data science teams used to create beautiful data apps in a relatively short amount of time.


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`pip install pandas`

`pip install streamlit`
`pip install plotly`
`pip install matplotlib`






    








## Deployment

We're going to be deploying our project onto Heroku.
Heroko is a cloud platform as a service that allows developers to build, run and scale the applications

Heroku will provide  a link to see the project live.
